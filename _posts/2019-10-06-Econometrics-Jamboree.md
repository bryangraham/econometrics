On Friday November 8th, 2019 the Berkeley econometrics group, in partnership with the Statistics Department, will host the third annual “Berkeley-Stanford Econometrics Jamboree”. The  event will run from 2PM to 6PM in room Jerzy Neyman Room (1011 Evans Hall). Attendence is open to anyone from the Berkeley and Stanford data science communities (broadly and inclusively defined) and there is no need to register. The event is intentionally informal. Please feel free to share these event details with others who may be interested.

A conference program can be found below. Please contact [Bryan Graham](bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu) with any corrections or possible scheduling conflicts. We’ve got a great group of speakers scheduled.

For our attendees coming from Stanford, Evans Hall is very close to the North Gate of our campus. The nearest BART stop is Downtown Berkeley. The nearest public parking facility is the Lower Hearst / North Gate parking garage at the intersection of Scenic & Hearst (enter from Scenic to access hourly parking spaces).

As we did last year, we will also organize a morning session consisting of short (20 minute) student presentations. **Student presentations will be held from 9AM to 11:30AM in the Neyman Room.** Currently confirmed student presenters are Lydia T. Liu, Horia Mania, Michael Pollmann, Fengshi Niu, and Evan Rose (exact order to be determined).

If you have any logistical questions please write [Fengshi Niu](fniu@berkeley.edu).
