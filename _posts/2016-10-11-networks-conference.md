We are very excited to welcome conference attendees to Berkeley on November 4th and 5th. A _preliminary_ conference program can be found below. Please contact [Bryan Graham](bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu) with any corrections or possible scheduling conflicts. If we have forgetten someone please let us know and we will do our best to make adjustments.

We've got a great group of speakers, from the statistics, econometrics and machine learning communities, scheduled.

The conference will be held in [Blum Hall Plaza](https://goo.gl/maps/LCeRH2WmiSK2) at UC Berkeley. The venue is very close to the North Gate of campus. The nearest BART stop is Downtown Berkeley. The nearest public parking facility is the Lower Hearst / North Gate parking garage at the intersection of Scenic & Hearst (enter from Scenic to access hourly parking spaces).

If you have any logistical questions please write [Eric Auerbach](eric.auerbach@econ.berkeley.edu). I will post additional information to this page over the coming weeks.

**IMPORTANT:** We have allocated 40 minutes for each talk. Please anticipate questions from the audience when planning your talk. You are very welcome to use _less_ than forty minutes and decidely not welcome to use _more_!

[^fn-speakers_dinner]: Unfortunately, due to very tight physical space constraints at the venue, the dinner is by invitation only. Soi 4 is a pleasant 2.5 mile walk from campus through the Elwood and Rockridge neighborhoods. Directions can be found [here](https://goo.gl/maps/vcEaZ47B3cE2). For those not wishing to walk, it is just a short Taxi/Uber ride away.
