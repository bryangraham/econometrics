On Friday and Saturday March 25th and 26th, 2022 the Center for the Application of Mathematics and Statistics to Economics (CAMSE)
will host a conference in Honor of the legendary James L. Powell. Attendence is by invitation only. 

The conference will be held in room B100 of the Blum Center. Directions to Blum Hall can be found [here](https://cstms.berkeley.edu/locations/blum-hall-b100/). Information on transit options from SFO and OAK airports can be found [here](https://internationaloffice.berkeley.edu/living/transport_from_airports).

Blum Hall is very close to the North Gate of campus. The nearest BART stop is Downtown Berkeley. The nearest public parking facility is the Lower Hearst / North Gate parking garage at the intersection of Scenic & Hearst (enter from Scenic to access hourly parking spaces). Blum Hall is also about a 10 to 15 minute walk (slightly uphill) from the conference hotel (the [Residence Inn by Marriott Berkeley](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/oakrr-residence-inn-berkeley/overview/?scid=635d1bd9-3cf2-4c95-9dad-35ac81b1349c&gclid=CjwKCAiA1JGRBhBSEiwAxXblwRdR5e9_rYDwwfdbZILCD8SiFimV3psGMXEAOGWQeaWC_O5k9-w07BoCbPkQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)).

Instructions on how to join the conference by Zoom will be sent as we get closer the date.

Campus and the City of Berkeley COVID guidelines evolve regularly. As of March 7th, indoor masking by vaccinnated individuals is no longer required on campus (instead being strongly recommended). However a variety of other COVID related measures remain intact. More information on current campus COVID policies can be found [here](https://coronavirus.berkeley.edu/).

The plan is to set up, weather permitting, coffee breaks and lunch outdoors. Eating outside has a number of advantages, one of which is that formal checking of vaccination status is not required. However all attendees should nevertheless bring proof of vaccination as it will be required to attend the conference dinner (also UC Berkeley has a vaccine mandate, even for conference attendees, so its a good idea to have some sort of proof on hand). 

The conference dinner will be held at [Agrodolce Berkeley](https://www.agrodolceberkeley.com/) at 7PM (time to be confirmed). This event will be in a large indoor room. In addition to enjoying one anothers company, there will be an opportunity to share stories about, and expressions of gratitude for, Jim.

A preliminary conference program can be found below (subject to change). Speakers should plan on presenting for approximately 20 minutes, allowing for five minutes of discussion and questions, and an additional five minutes of transition time between speakers.
