On Friday November 19th, 2021 the Berkeley econometrics group will host the fourth annual “Berkeley-Stanford Econometrics Jamboree”. The  event will consist of a morning session of student presentations (9AM to 11:30AM) and an afternoon session of faculty presentations (2PM to 6PM). The morning session will take place in the legendary venue 639 Evans Hall. To accommodate a somewat larger group, the afternoon session will take place in 290 Hearst Memorial Mining Building. This magnificient building is adjacent to Evans Hall.  

Attendence is open to anyone from the Berkeley and Stanford data science communities (broadly and inclusively defined). Due to campus protocols regarding COVID-19, masks will be worn by all participants and no food or beverages will be provided. Berkeley affiliates are expected to meet all requirements for being on campus. Our Stanford guests should operate as if their own campus guidelines apply. The City of Berkeley requires proof of COVID-19 vaccination for indoor dining; so attendees (self-catered) lunch and dinner options will be greater if you bring such proof.

I do not expect to have to limit attendance, but to ensure a safe and comfortable event there is some chance I will. For this reason I ask that you let me know whether you will attend (and whether for the AM session, PM session or both). The event is otherwise intentionally informal. Please feel free to share these event details with others who may be interested.

A preliminary conference program can be found below. Please contact [Bryan Graham](bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu) with any corrections or possible scheduling conflicts. We’ve got a great group of speakers scheduled.

For our attendees coming from Stanford, Evans Hall is very close to the North Gate of our campus. The nearest BART stop is Downtown Berkeley. The nearest public parking facility is the Lower Hearst / North Gate parking garage at the intersection of Scenic & Hearst (enter from Scenic to access hourly parking spaces).
