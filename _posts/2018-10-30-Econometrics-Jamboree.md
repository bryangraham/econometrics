On Friday November 30th, 2018 the Berkeley econometrics group, in partnership with the Statistics Department (through their NSF Research and Training Grant "Advancing Machine Learning - Causality and Interpretability") will host the second annual “Berkeley-Stanford Econometrics Jamboree”. The  event will run from 2PM to 6PM in room Jerzy Neyman Room (1011 Evans Hall). Attendence is open to anyone from the Berkeley and Stanford data science communities (broadly and inclusively defined) and there is no need to register. The event is intentionally informal. Please feel free to share these event details with others who may be interested.

A conference program can be found below. Please contact [Bryan Graham](bgraham@econ.berkeley.edu) with any corrections or possible scheduling conflicts. We’ve got a great group of speakers scheduled.

For our attendees coming from Stanford, Evans Hall is very close to the North Gate of our campus. The nearest BART stop is Downtown Berkeley. The nearest public parking facility is the Lower Hearst / North Gate parking garage at the intersection of Scenic & Hearst (enter from Scenic to access hourly parking spaces).

This year we will also organize a morning session consisting of short student presentations. Details on this portion of the event will be made available when finalized.

If you have any logistical questions please write [Ingrid Haegele](inha@berkeley.edu).
