On Thursday April 11th, 2024 the Center for the Application of Mathematics and Statistics to Economics (CAMSE) and the Center for the Theoretical Foundations of Learning, Inference, Information, Intelligence, Mathematics and Microeconomics at Berkeley (CLIMB) will host a half day mini-conference. The goal is to bring in campus researchers at the intersection of economics, machine learning/AI and statistics. Attendence is open to anyone from the Berkeley and Stanford data science communities (broadly and inclusively defined). Registration is not required.

The conference will be held in room 250 of Sutardja Dai Hall on the north side of the UC Berkeley campus (close to the North Gate of campus). The nearest BART stop is Downtown Berkeley. The nearest public parking facility is the Lower Hearst / North Gate parking garage at the intersection of Scenic & Hearst (enter from Scenic to access hourly parking spaces).
