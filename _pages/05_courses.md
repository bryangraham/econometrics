Occassionally I teach short courses on econometric methods for the analysis of spillovers and network data. I have also taught standard microeconometric topics, including covariate adjustment, program evaluation and panel data. Courses typically emphasize both theory and practical computation.

Selected materials from some of past courses are available below (more materials, including those from older course iterations, can be found directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/bryangraham/short_courses).
